## Introduction
HiGNN is a well-designed hierarchical and interactive informative graph neural networks framework for predicting molecular property by utilizing a co-representation learning of molecular graphs and chemically synthesizable BRICS fragments. Meanwhile, a plug-and-play feature-wise attention block was first designed in HiGNN architecture to adaptively recalibrate atomic features after message passing phase.
